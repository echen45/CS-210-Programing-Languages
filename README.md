# CS-210-Programing-Languages

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project required displaying the frequency of the produce items in a file and creating a histogram of a file of produce items and their frequency.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job storing the data in a map and vector.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could have replaced certain PrintSymbol functions with setw functions. This would have made things more concise.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Opening the source file might have been the most challenging code to write. I moved the source file into the same folder as the code. I currently don't plan on adding anything to my support network.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Opening a file and storing data in a map will probably be useful for other projects or course work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used inline comments and made the code concise and simple.
